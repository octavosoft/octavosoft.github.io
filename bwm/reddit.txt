managing browsing windows

In your work related activities, using a Windows operating system, do you have many open browser windows that are hard to manage? For example, you open a series of windows each with its own category (e.g. news, search, technology, etc), and within each window you have multiple tabs representing a particular task you are working on? Sometimes there are too many tabs in one window and you wish you could spread them on multiple windows and use a hierarchical rather than linear approach to managing the windows? If this describes your usual workflow take a look at the Browser Window Manager application that has the following features: (a) keeps track of the visited browser windows and allows navigation back and forth between them the same way browsers navigate the web, (b) has the ability to set categories for windows and activate them within category in a round-robin fashion, (c) provides all functionality through keyboard shortcuts which can be redefined.
